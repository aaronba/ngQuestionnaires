  <p>ngQuestionnaires is a single page application using AngularJS 1.2.0 rc3.</p>

  <p>It is a demonstration application, used for learning, with sufficient complexity to exercise common aspects of
    sophisticated web applications such as many-to-many relationships, nested collections, CRUD operations,
    pagination, search, filters, animations, visualizations etc.</p>

  <p>It uses Firebase to store data as JSON without the need for a server-side proxy.</p>

  <p>It uses d3 visualization library to generate charts for the question choices.</p>

  <p>It uses Bootstrap to provide a responsive user interface that works equally well on all devices.</p>
